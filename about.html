            <p>Etoile Dance Company was founded in 2012 through a passion for 
            making dance accessible to everyone. Historically, dance has always 
            been an expensive endeavor that few can afford. With research 
            showing that dance has a plethora of physical and mental benefits, 
            including but not limited to increased muscle strength, improved 
            cardiovascular health, and higher level of confidence, the founder 
            of Etoile Dance Company wanted to bring these benefits to all 
            members of the community. Etoile Dance Company works with each 
            individual's budget and welcomes everyone into its safe space that 
            allows freedom of individual expression. Etoile Dance Company offers 
            a variety of different classes, including ballet, contemporary, 
            hip hop, jazz, and yoga to provide something for everyone. Please

                    <h3>Founder/Artistic Director</h3>
                    <p>Diane Chen is the founder and artistic director of 
                        Etoile Dance Company. Diane was a lead, professional 
                        dancer at the Oregon Ballet Theatre for over 15 years. 
                        Originally from China, she learned the art of dance in 
                        a small village in the Yunnan Province. Her dance 
                        lessons took place on the cobblestones outside her 
                        dance instructor's house. When she was 12 years old, 
                        Diane's parents decided to make a big change and moved 
                        to the United States. Diane knew that that was her 
                        chance to become a professional dancer and despite 
                        being a disadvantaged first generation immigrant, she 
                        fought for her dream. She now wants to pass her dream 
                        on to other aspiring dancers. </p>

                    <p>Amari was born and raised in San Francisco, California. 
                        She started her dancing career at the age of 3 years 
                        old. At age 10, she joined the San Francisco Dance 
                        Company, where she started her professional training as 
                        a dancer. Amari met Diane at a summer intensive program
                         at the New York City Ballet when they were only 17 
                         years old. When Diane decided to open her own dance 
                         studio, Amari was quick to move to Portland, Oregon to 
                         switch her career from a professional dancer to a 
                         dance instructor. </p>
                    <p class="quote">“Giving students confidence and self-esteem 
                        through dance is one of my favorite things about being

                    <p>Emily is a native Oregonian. She was born and raised in 
                        Bend; a city surrounded by mountains. Emily was trained 
                        in classical ballet from the age of 6. In high school, 
                        she joined the dance team and quickly fell in love with 
                        jazz and show-dance. While getting her undergraduate 
                        degree in performing arts at the University of Oregon, 
                        she coached the high school varsity dance team at 
                        Rockfield High School and helped them win the state 
                        championships three years in a row. After graduating 
                        college, she moved to Portland, Oregon and Diane quickly 
                        welcomed her to her team.</p>
                    <p class="quote">“I love the emotions one can express 
                        through dance. The right facial expressions and 
                        movements can express so much sadness, joy, or anger. 
                        I'm excited to teach others the art.”</p>

                        York to fulfill her dream of becoming a professional 
                        ballerina. During her time there, Gabby met Diane and

                          but he fell in love with dance. After high school, he

                            to perform in the show “Rock the Ballet,” a hip

                             into a funky performance. After traveling the 
                             world, he was asked to participate in “Dancing

                             season 5. Retiring from the hectic lifestyle, he
